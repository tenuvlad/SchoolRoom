            Apollo University is a place for learning AspNetCore and related technologies.  This demo application is an amalgamation of smaller demo applications found in tutorials at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/">AspNetCore docs</a>.  The tutorials are great at demonstrating isolated concepts, but issues surfaces when applying these concepts/techniques in a larger context.  The purpose of this demo application is to apply concepts/techniques learned from those tutorial into a single domain (i.e. university).
